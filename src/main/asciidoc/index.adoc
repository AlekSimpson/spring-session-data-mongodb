[[abstract]]

Spring Session MongoDB provides an API and implementations for managing a user's session information on MongoDB.

[[introduction]]
== Introduction

For an introduction to Spring Session as a whole, visit http://docs.spring.io/spring-session/docs/{spring-session-version}/reference/html5/[Spring Session] itself.

=== HttpSession with Mongo

Using Spring Session with `HttpSession` is enabled by adding a Servlet Filter before anything that uses the `HttpSession`.

This section describes how to use Mongo to back `HttpSession` using Java based configuration.

NOTE: The <<samples, HttpSession Mongo Sample>> provides a working sample on how to integrate Spring Session and `HttpSession` using Java configuration.
You can read the basic steps for integration below, but you are encouraged to follow along with the detailed HttpSession Guide when integrating with your own application.

==== Session serialization mechanisms

To be able to persist session objects in MongoDB we need to provide the serialization/deserialization mechanism.
Depending on your classpath Spring Session will choose one of two build-in converters:

* `JacksonMongoSessionConverter` when `ObjectMapper` class is available, or
* `JdkMongoSessionConverter` otherwise.

===== JacksonMongoSessionConverter

This mechanism uses Jackson to serialize session objects to/from JSON.
`JacksonMongoSessionConverter` will be the default when Jackson is detected on the classpath and the user has not explicitly registered a `AbstractMongoSessionConverter` Bean.

If you would like to provide custom Jackson modules you can do it by explicitly registering `JacksonMongoSessionConverter`:

----

==== JdkMongoSessionConverter

`JdkMongoSessionConverter` uses standard Java serialization to persist session attributes map to MongoDB in a binary form.
However, standard session elements like id, access time, etc are still written as a plain Mongo objects and can be read and queried without additional effort.
`JdkMongoSessionConverter` is used if Jackson is not on the classpath and no explicit `AbstractMongoSessionConverter` Bean has been defined.
You can explicitly register `JdkMongoSessionConverter` by defining it as a Bean.

There is also a constructor taking `Serializer` and `Deserializer` objects, allowing you to pass custom implementations, which is especially important when you want to use non-default classloader.
